    //NOTE: basic transitions are either JUST integers or a MIXTURE of character or integers.
    //With the first approach everything (including 256 for endOfFileCharacter) is internally
    //an integer but WHEN YOU PRINT IT, you print anything printable as a character and anything
    //unprintable as an integer (e.g., tab is unprintable).
	//The following Smalltalk code (easily convertible to Swift) can be placed in class Grammar

    //Consider
    //isPrintableAsCharacter: integer
    //  | printable |
    //  (integer < 0 | integer >= 255) ifTrue: [^false].
    //  The following string ends with an underscore, a double quote, and a single quote.
    //	printable := 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!,+-/\*~=@%&?|<>_"'''.
    //  ^printable indexOf: integer asCharacter > 0


    //Examples building an FSM with attributes (ask the grammar for the default attributes; see details
    //in parserFSMd.txt; scanner defaults should be read, noStack, noNode, keep)
    fsm1 = $+; //Should default to "RK"
    fsm2 = $a [noKeep]; //Should have attribute "R"
    fsm3 = {$a}; //Braces means LOOK. Should have attribute "L"
    fsm4 = 256; //EndOfFileCharacter: Cannot be converted to a character.
    fsm5 = 32 [noKeep]; //Space character: The attribute should be "R". 
    fsm6 = 10 [noKeep]; //LineEnd character: This is not a printable character

    //The following are ROOT building semantic actions because
    //they are preceded by "=>". That information is stored in a LABEL object .
    //Also, note that parameters should be characters, integers, strings, or symbols depending
    //on whether their labels are #walkCharacter: #walkInteger:, #walkString:, or walkSymbol.
    //Swift doesn't have symbols so strings in their place.

    fsm7 = => Number; //This should create semantic transition #buildToken: with parameters "Number", a string, NOT a token).

    fsm9 = => #buildBirdRoutine:with: [1 2];  //This one should create semantic transition #buildBirdRoutine:with: with parameters containing integers 1 and 2.
    fsm10 = => #between:and: [10 20];  //This one should create semantic transition #between:and: with parameters containing integers 10 and 20.
    fsm11 = => #testing;  //This one should create semantic transition #testing with parameters consisting of an empty collection.
